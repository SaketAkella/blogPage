He relates how his needs and habits have had to change over the years to accommodate his sometimes wildly varying auditory abilities. Most importantly, he writes, his loss is not just related to snippets of lost conversation, but of the intimacy that can be intrinsic in sound.</p></td>

For The Baffler, Dolly Church explores afterlife possibilities and cutting-edge disposition options at the intersection of the funeral and aerospace industries. Through companies like Beyond Burials, Celestis, and Elysium Space, customers can send a small amount of their cremains into space, while their loved ones can opt into a selection of customized packages and memorial events to celebrate the departed. (One company, Celestis, has also expanded into the business of launching DNA into space for “storage and preservation.”) Church asks: “Why be landfill when you can be stardust (or rather, orbiting space debris) instead? </p></td>
